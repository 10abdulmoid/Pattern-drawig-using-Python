Hi there this is my first upload on github.
I did this while larning python from bro code yt channel.

Jumping to the code it requires you to enter the number of rows and columns which we will cast as an int data type
then we will accept the symbol of which the pattern should be made up of.
 we will use nested loops outer loop of rows and inner loop for columns.
